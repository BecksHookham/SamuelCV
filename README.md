I am Full-Stack Developer about to graduate from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) with strong foundations in computer programming.
I am a hard working, well organized and extremely enthusiastic individual who is always willing to try new things when the opportunity arises. I work and communicate very well with others, always putting my full potential in everything I do.

After working in retail for the past 5 years, I decided to challenge myself into the exciting world of Software Engineering. What fascinates me the most is the possibility to learn new things everyday and use technology at its highest potential to create something useful and efficient that could have an impact on people’s life.

I am greatly motivated to join a company where I can use the skills that I have gained, with the determination to keep on improving and extending my competences in programming.
