## Samuel Raducan

I am a highly motivated individual who wants to be challenged so that I can reach my full potential in Software Development. 
I am very keen to gain experience within a company so that I can put my knowledge and the skills that I have aquired at Makers Academy to use.
I believe communication is essential when dealing with clients, users or teammates, especially when relaying information.
