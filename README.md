After gaining customer service experience and conflict resolution skills while working in retail for five years, I have decided to change profession and pursue my career goal of becoming a Software Engineer. I'm a recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate, where I have studied a â€˜Full-Stack Developer programmeâ€™. This has strengthened my expertise and foundations in computer programming. My ambition is to build a software application that is appealing and easy to use.  

Iâ€™m determined to continue extending my knowledge in software development and coding. I am hardworking, driven and possess excellent organisational skills, which makes me an ideal candidate that would flourish in this sector. I am an enthusiastic individual who enjoys both working in a team or independently to deliver successful projects and relish the opportunity to put my skills to use in a thriving business.
