After gaining customer service experience and conflict resolution skills while working in retail for 4+ years, I have decided to change profession and pursue my career goal of becoming a Software Developer. I'm a recent [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) graduate, where I have studied a â€˜Full-Stack Developer programmeâ€™. This has strengthened my expertise to adopt coding best-practices and develop strong foundations in computer programming. 

I'm determined to continue extending my skills and knowledge in software development. I'm a methodical problem solver when working and collaborating with others and I have the drive to learn and test new concepts as the technology evolves fast and it brings meaningful changes in almost every major industry.
