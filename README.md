Software Developer â€“ a Makers Academy graduate with a background in stock management and customer service,
ready to step into the tech world. Able to work well individually but especially on team projects, with the aim of delivering clean and high-quality code. Constantly driven to keep learning and growing both personally and professionally and always ready to meet challenges and new opportunities. Thrilled to work for a company with a stimulating environment, diverse and inclusive with a collaborative spirit and growth opportunities, while contributing with my skills and potential to the fullest
<!-- With a retail and customer support background, problem-solving and high quality service delivery have been at the forefront of my professional life. Meanwhile my curiosity in technology introduced me to the world of coding so I decided to challenge myself and pursue a new career goal as software developer to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction and make real-world impact with my skills through tech.

 My career-changing journey started by teaching myself for a while until I came across [Makers Academy Bootcamp](https://makers.tech/), where I have adopted coding best-practices and developed an even stronger foundation of programming concepts. I operate well individually, though I thrive in a collaborative environment as part of a productive team to produce high-quality-code.

 I'm constantly driven to keep learning and growing both personally and professionally and always ready to meet challenges and new opportunities. I am thrilled by the opportunity of working in a company with a supportive and stimulating environment where I can bring my dedication and my skills to make my part in an ever evolving tech world in need of immediate and constant solutions.  -->


<!-- As a self-motivated and driven individual with a curiosity in technology, I decided to challenge myself and pursue my career goal in software development to seek a more fulfilling and creative professional direction.

I began my career-changing journey by self-teaching myself how to code and then with [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) where I have adopted coding best-practices and developed a strong foundation of programming concepts. This has enabled me to both self-manage during individual projects, as well as collaborate as part of a productive team to produce high-quality-code.

I'm determined to continue extending my programming knowledge as a software developer. I'm a methodical problem solver when working and collaborating with others and I have the drive to learn and test new concepts as the technology evolves fast and it brings meaningful changes in almost every major industry. -->

## **Soft Skills**

#### **Communication & Methodical Approach To Work-Load**

My previous role as a Stock Coordinator often included planning ahead; communicating with the team to better cooperate on the stock management; conducting a detailed review procedures to value the stock correctly and therefore being able to make better operational decisions for the profitability of the business. 

Makers Academy strongly embeds pair programming into its bootcamp, so working with people from different backgrounds helped me develop the ability to solve problems collaboratively and further enhanced my communication style. When working within a group or while pair programming, I can effectively articulate project needs and resolve challenges that arise.

#### **Collaboration & Team Player**

I am an adaptable and dedicated team player, which has been evident throughout my professional career and during my time at Makers Academy. I have always thrived within a team environment, where collaboration and strong values are part of my work ethics and vital to ensuring a high performing organisation.
In fact, during the four years of my employment, I helped grow the efficiency of the stock management by 35%.

During my time at Makers, I have continuously demonstrated an effective collaborative mindset within group environments to create high quality projects. One notable mention is the â€˜Makers BnBâ€™ which is a short-term rental website for travellers built by me and my team. 
Throughout the two-week production of the application, the team and I provided both technical and EQ support. We ran two daily stand ups and a retrospective catchup at the end of each day to manage our workflow and ensured that everyone felt heard.

I always seek to develop strong relationships and aspire to display positivity amongst colleagues, and strongly value the key fundamentals of teamwork. 

#### **Organised & Fast-Learner**

I always show dedication and interest in a new type of employment as I'm very curious, so I generally pick up things quite quickly.  During my time in retail, when I was given the management of a whole stock department, I learnt from the experience of my colleagues and then took on more responsibilities in a short time frame.
What helps me in this regards is having an organised approach to my workload to ensure that deadlines and targets are met, and that my time is used efficiently by prioritising tasks and making a plan of action, for example by creating a daily schedule to follow and by often bringing my work ahead.
 
At Makers, time management was crucial. Each weekend I was given an individual project to work on and to be presented at the beginning of the following week, so I was ensuring to split it in smaller tasks and used different tools to enhance my efficiency such as the pomodoro technique, trello board for managing the tickets, miro and diagrams.net for note-taking and process modeling.
My experience with programming has stimulated even further my ability to take on new technical skills very quickly both during the bootcamp and during the time I set aside each day for self-learning and improving.
<!-- 
Even during my time at Makers, the workload was often intense so my organisational skills and time management have been further established. Each weekend I was given an individual project to work on and to be presented at the beginning of the following week, so I was ensuring to split it in smaller tasks and used different tools to enhance my efficiency such as the pomodoro technique at each stage. Particularly in my last two group projects, I used a number of organisational tools to prioritise agile development. This included Trello- a Kanban project board for managing tickets and observing workflow, Google drive- to store our resources and documentation of our daily stand-ups and retros, and GitHub issues- to focus on important tasks and manage workflow simultaneously. Additionally, I've used a variety of tools to assist with my note-taking and process modelling, such as Miro and Diagrams.net. -->

<!-- 
I am a fast-learner and always show dedication and interest in a new type of employment. I mainly observe, take note, do my own research and then apply what I learn. Even when I had little experience in retail and was given the management of a whole stock department, I learnt from the experience of my colleagues and then took on more responsibilities in a short time frame.
My experience with programming has stimulated even further my ability to take on new skills very quickly. During my time before and after Makers I have continuously made it a goal to set aside time each day to keep self-learning through online courses.
During the four month-intense bootcamp I picked up new languages, acquired new methods of programming and learnt to work on various projects.  -->
